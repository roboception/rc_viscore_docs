Installation

Warning: The instructions on

  Safety

   related to the

  rc_viscore

   stereo camera must be read and understood prior to installation.

Mounting

The

rc_viscore

 stereo camera is intended to be mounted on a wall or ceiling above
the target area. It is not intended to be used in dynamic applications
mounted to a robot wrist. It is the customer’s responsibility to
provide an adequate mounting bracket.

For mounting, the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera provides an M4 and M5 thread pattern on its top and
bottom sides (see

Fig. 7

). A medium-strength thread-locker or Tuflok® screws must be used to
protect against vibrations. M5 screws must be tightened to 4.0 Nm, M4
screws must be tightened to 3.3 Nm.

Warning: The

  rc_viscore

   stereo camera cannot be mounted on the end-effector of a robot.


Only the surface containing the thread pattern must be in contact with
the mounting bracket, all other surfaces must remain free. At least 10
cm clearance must be provided behind the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera to facilitate adequate air flow for cooling.

Power-up

Note: Always fully connect and tighten all M12 connectors on the

  rc_viscore

   stereo camera

  before

   turning on the power supply.

After connecting the system to power, the LED on the front of the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera should immediately illuminate.

Warning: Do not look into the projector lens in the center of the

  rc_viscore

   stereo camera or into the light beam at any point during startup or
  operation.

Connecting

The

rc_viscore

 stereo camera can be used together with an

rc_cube

 or as a stand-alone high-resolution RGBD camera with the
SGM®producer. The following sections describe connecting the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera in both scenarios.

Connecting to the rc_cube

The

rc_cube

 I (Industrial Edge Computer) offers four network ports that are
labelled sensors 0-3. The two network cables of the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera must be connected directly to two of those ports. It
does not matter which ones. Two stereo cameras can be connected and
used at the same time.

The

rc_cube

 S (Edge Computer) offers one 2.5 gigabit sensor port. A switch must
be used for connecting an

rc_viscore

 stereo camera. The switch must support 2.5 gigabit for the connection
to the

rc_cube

 and 1 gigabit speed for the connection to the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera. The switch is not in the scope of the delivery of the

rc_cube

 S. Roboception can recommend a suitable switch upon request.

By default, the

rc_cube

 is configured to support one

rc_visard

 as sensor. For supporting one

rc_viscore

 stereo camera, the type of the camera pipeline must be changed in the
Web GUI of the

rc_cube

 under System ‣ Camera Pipelines (see

https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/pipelines.html

). Clicking on Configure Camera Pipelines opens a dialog that permits
to change the type of pipeline to "rc_viscore". A reboot is necessary
after changing the pipeline configuration.

For connecting two stereo cameras at the same time, it is additionally
necessary to configure a second pipeline, as explained above, and to
specify which pipeline should use which

rc_viscore

 stereo camera by setting a filter expression. This is done by
clicking on Configure Camera Connection on the

Camera Pipelines

 page, or select the corresponding pipeline in the menu, e.g. under
System ‣ Camera Pipelines ‣ Pipeline .... Clicking Choose Camera opens
a dialog to edit the device filter (see also

https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/pipelines.html#configuration-of-
connected-cameras

).

It may take up to one minute until the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera is connected. For each successfully connected sensor,
the connection speed and frame rate is shown in the Dashboard of the
Web GUI.

Connecting to the SGM®Producer

For using the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera as high-resolution RGBD camera, Roboception offers the
SGM®Producer, which is a GenICam compatible transport layer (see

https://roboception.com/product/sgmproducer

).

The producer can be used with Halcon, with the rc_genicam_api for C++
programmers, with the rc_genicam_driver for ROS and ROS2, as well as
with any other GenICam compatible application. It can be downloaded
free of charge from

https://www.roboception.com/download

 and installed on Windows and Ubuntu computers with an Nvidia graphics
card.

It is strongly recommended to connect both network cables directly to
1 gigabit Ethernet ports of the computer. A network switch can only
work if the network link between the switch and the computer has a
bandwidth of more than 2 gigabit, e.g. 2.5, 5 or 10 gigabit.

In the default network configuration and according to the GigE Vision®
standard, the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera cameras will try to obtain their configuration from a
DHCP server and fall back to the Link-Local self-configuration
protocol, if no DHCP server can be found. For direct connection
without a DHCP server, the Ethernet ports of the computer should be
configured for Link-Local network. It is also possible to manually
configure IP addresses of the left and right camera.

Options for changing the network settings and IP configuration are:

   any configuration tool compatible with GigE Vision® 2.0, or
   Roboception's command-line tool gc_config. Typically, these tools
   scan for all available GigE Vision® devices on the network. All
   rc_viscore stereo camera devices can be uniquely identified by
   their serial number, which is printed on the device.

   temporarily changing the network configuration via Roboception's
   rcdiscover-gui tool. The individual cameras can be seen in the list
   after unchecking the Only Roboception devices check box.

Note: The command-line tool "gc_config" is part of Roboception's
  open- source convenience layer "rc_genicam_api", which can be
  downloaded free of charge for Windows and Linux from

  https://www.roboception.com/download

  .

For adjusting the focus, checking and calibrating the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera, as explained in the next sections, the SGM®Producer
package contains a calibration program, called *rc_calib*.

Adjust focus

It is highly recommended to check and adjust the focus of the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera for the actual working range. Please note that the
depth of focus range is limited due to the high resolution of the
camera and must be adapted to the working range of the application. At
close distance, the depth of focus range is much smaller than at
higher distance. Therefore, the minimum distance for focusing should
be chosen as far away as useful for the application. Please

contact support

 in case of questions regarding working distance and calibration of
the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera.

The

rc_cube

 offers a focus helper as part of camera calibration under Pipeline
... ‣ Configuration ‣ Camera Calibration. In the first step, the size
of the calibration grid has to be specified. Clicking on Next opens
the focus helper. See also

https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/camera_calibration.html

.

For users of the SGM®Producer, the focus helper can be found in the
*rc_calib* calibration program after selecting the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera with File ‣ Connect sensor ..., and specifying the grid
size.

The bars on the right side of the image report the blur of the
calibration grid, thus a minimum is desirable. The grid should be
placed in the minimum and maximum working distance for checking the
current blur. A value near the lowest dividing line is quite optimal.
See also

https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/camera_calibration.html#adjust-focus

.

If focus adjustment is needed, the lens caps of the left and right
cameras must be removed as shown in

Fig. 8

.


The focus ring and the aperture ring are locked by 3 screws for each
ring as shown in

Fig. 9

. All three screws must be loosened for moving the ring.


For setting the focus correctly, the calibration grid should be placed
in the middle of the working range. Then, the focus ring should be
turned until the bars in the images become a minimum. After focusing
in this way, the grid should be placed at the minimum and maximum
working distance. If the blur is unsatisfactory at the minimum and
maximum working distance (e.g. near the second dividing line or
higher), the aperture can be closed a bit, i.e. choosing a higher
aperture number. Please be aware that this increases exposure time and
potentially gain, which increases noise in the image. The optimal
tradeoff is application dependent.

Warning: The same aperture setting must be used for the left and
  right camera to avoid degraded image processing performance. Please
  validate that the left and right images appear with the same
  brightness.

After adjusting focus and aperture, all screws must be tightened and
the lens caps re-attached.

To change focus and aperture settings of the projector, loosen the
three small fixing Phillips screws on the respective ring of the
projector lens, turn the ring to the desired setting and lightly
tighten the screws again. For focus adjustments, the projector should
be turned on permanently by setting the Out1 mode to High in the Web
GUI.  For aperture adjustments, Out1 should be set to
ExposureAlternateActive and exposure mode should be set to ‚Auto‘ on
the Web GUI's Camera page.  Perfectly focusing the projector is not
crucial. Slightly blurred projection will not degrade the depth image.

Calibration

After checking and potentially adjusting the focus, the next step is
to check calibration. This step should never be skipped and -- as
opposed to all

rc_visard

 products -- is mandatory. Please note that the working range of the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera is pre-defined and the calibration should be checked
for the minimum and maximum working range. Please

contact support

 in case of questions regarding working distance and calibration of
the

rc_viscore

 stereo camera.

The

rc_cube

 manual explains checking and re-calibrating in detail (see

https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/camera_calibration.html#verify-
calibration

). The procedure that is described their can be applied in the same
way to the SGM®Producer, by using the *rc_calib* program that is
provided with the producer.

Warning: It is mandatory to always check calibration after mounting
  the

  rc_viscore

   stereo camera, changing the focus or aperture. After calibration,
  also a new hand-eye calibration is required.

Note: Roboception will deliver the

  rc_viscore

   stereo camera with pre-adjusted focus to make sure it works in the
  desired depth range. Please

  contact support

   and provide your specification to enable us to set up the

  rc_viscore

   stereo camera accordingly. An onsite calibration check is still
  required to make sure that no problem occurred during delivery or
  mounting.
