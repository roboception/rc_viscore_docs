Overview

The

rc_viscore

 is a high-resolution IP54-protected 3D stereo sensor with an
integrated

rc_randomdot

 pattern projector. The

rc_viscore

 provides 12MP camera images and -- in combination with an

rc_cube

 or the SGM®producer -- depth, confidence and error images. The
integrated

rc_randomdot

 projector allows for dense depth images even in weakly textured
scenes and the high resolution permits the detection of small parts
with high accuracy.

In combination with the

rc_cube

, the

rc_viscore

 provides the data for object detection and grasp computation
applications, e.g. in industrial automation and logistics
applications.
