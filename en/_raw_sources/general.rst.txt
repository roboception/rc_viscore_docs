========

The |rc_viscore_camera| is a high-resolution IP54-protected 3D stereo camera with an integrated |rc_randomdot_projector|.
The |rc_viscore_camera| provides 12MP camera images and -- in combination with :mvexclude:`an |rc_cube| or` the SGM\ |reg|\ producer -- 
depth, confidence and error images. The integrated |rc_randomdot_projector| projects a random dot pattern and
allows for dense depth images even in weakly textured scenes and the high resolution permits the detection of small parts
with high accuracy.
