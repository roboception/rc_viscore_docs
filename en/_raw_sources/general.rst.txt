Overview
========

The |rc_viscore| is a high-resolution IP54-protected 3D stereo sensor with an integrated |rc_randomdot| pattern projector.
The |rc_viscore| provides 12MP camera images and -- in combination with an |rc_cube| or the SGM\ |reg|\ producer -- 
depth, confidence and error images. The integrated |rc_randomdot| projector
allows for dense depth images even in weakly textured scenes and the high resolution permits the detection of small parts
with high accuracy.

In combination with the |rc_cube|, the |rc_viscore| provides the data for object detection and grasp computation
applications, e.g. in industrial automation and logistics applications.
