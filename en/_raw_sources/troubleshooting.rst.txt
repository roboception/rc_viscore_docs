Hardware issues
---------------

**LED does not illuminate**

The |rc_viscore| does not start up.

- Ensure that cables are connected and secured properly.
- Ensure that adequate DC voltage (24 V) with correct polarity is applied to the
  power connector at the pins labeled as **Power** and **Ground** as described in
  the device's :ref:`pin assignment specification<tab-power-pin-assignments>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:tab-power-pin-assignments})`.
  Connecting the sensor to voltage outside of the specified range, to alternating current,
  with reversed polarity, or to a supply with voltage spikes will lead to permanent hardware damage.

**Reliability issues and/or mechanical damage**

This may be an indication of ambient conditions (vibration, shock, resonance, and temperature) being outside
of specified range. Please refer to the :ref:`specification of environmental conditions<tab-hardware-environment>`:latex:`\ (Section \ref{hardware_spec:tab-hardware-environment})`.

- Operating the |rc_viscore| outside of specified ambient conditions might lead to damage and will void the warranty.

**Electrical shock when touching the projector**

This indicates an electrical fault in sensor, cabling, or power supply or adjacent system.

- Immediately turn off power to the system, disconnect cables, and have a qualified electrician check the setup.
- Ensure that the projector housing is properly grounded; check for large ground loops.

Sparse depth images
-------------------

The depth images of the |rc_viscore|, which can be seen on the depth image page in
the |rc_cube|'s |webgui| or by using the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer, may have
missing values, which are shown in black. Missing values near object borders are normal.
If major parts of the depth image are invalid, then this may be due to the following
reasons:

- The scene may be out of the current working range of the |rc_viscore|. Depending on the depth
  quality, reducing the parameter *Maximum Distance* also reduces the possible minimum distance. In the
  |webgui| of the |rc_cube|, the used depth range is given on the depth image page below the
  images. Sliders on the depth image page permit to change the depth range. See also
  :numref:`tab-common-depth-ranges` for examples of possible depth ranges.
- Depth values may be missing on objects without texture. In this case, the internal random
  dot projector should be used for projecting an artificial texture. For single shot
  depth images, the `Single+Out1` mode should be selected on the depth image page of the
  |rc_cube|'s |webgui|. For continuously computing depth images, the projector should be turned
  on for every second image by setting `Out1` to `ExposureAlternateActive` in
  :menuselection:`Pipeline X --> Configuration --> IOControl`.
- The focus may be inadequate for the working range. Please check the focus using a calibration
  grid as described in :ref:`sect-adjust-focus`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-adjust-focus})`.
- The calibration of the |rc_viscore| may be inaccurate. Please check the calibration as described
  in :ref:`sect-calibration`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-calibration})`.
