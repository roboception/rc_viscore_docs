Installation
============

.. index::
   single: installation

.. Warning:: The instructions on :ref:`sect-safety`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{safety:sect-safety})`
  related to the |rc_viscore_camera| must be read and understood prior to installation.

Mounting
--------

.. index::
   single: mounting

The |rc_viscore_camera| is intended to be mounted on a wall or ceiling above the target
area. It is not intended to be used in dynamic applications mounted to a robot
wrist. It is the customerâ€™s responsibility to provide an adequate mounting
bracket.

For mounting, the |rc_viscore_camera| provides an M4 and M5 thread pattern on its top and
bottom sides (see :numref:`fig-mounting`). A medium-strength thread-locker or
Tuflok\ |reg| screws must be used to protect against vibrations. M5 screws must be
tightened to 4.0 Nm, M4 screws must be tightened to 3.3 Nm.

.. Warning:: The |rc_viscore_camera| cannot be mounted on the end-effector of a robot.

   Mounting of the |rc_viscore_camera|

Only the surface containing the thread pattern must be in contact with the
mounting bracket, all other surfaces must remain free. At least 10 cm clearance
must be provided behind the |rc_viscore_camera| to facilitate adequate air flow for
cooling.

Power-up
--------

.. index::
  single: power-up

.. Note:: Always fully connect and tighten all M12 connectors on the |rc_viscore_camera|
  *before* turning on the power supply.

After connecting the system to power, the LED on the front of the |rc_viscore_camera| should
immediately illuminate.

.. Warning:: Do not look into the projector lens in the center of the |rc_viscore_camera| or
   into the light beam at any point during startup or operation.

Connecting
----------

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler
      
   The |rc_viscore_camera| can be used together with an |rc_cube| or as a stand-alone high-resolution 
   RGBD camera with the SGM\ |reg|\ producer. The following sections describe
   connecting the |rc_viscore_camera| in both scenarios.

   Connecting to the rc_cube
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++

   .. index::
      pair: connecting; rc_cube

   The |rc_cube| I (Industrial Edge Computer) offers four network ports that are
   labelled sensors 0-3. The two network cables of the |rc_viscore_camera| must be
   connected directly to two of those ports. It does not matter which ones. Two
   stereo cameras can be connected and used at the same time.

   The |rc_cube| S (Edge Computer) offers one 2.5 gigabit sensor port. A switch
   must be used for connecting an |rc_viscore_camera|. The switch must support 2.5
   gigabit for the connection to the |rc_cube| and 1 gigabit speed for the
   connection to the |rc_viscore_camera|. The switch is not in the scope of the delivery
   of the |rc_cube| S. |manufacturer| can recommend a suitable switch upon
   request.

   By default, the |rc_cube| is configured to support one |rc_visard| as sensor. For
   supporting one |rc_viscore_camera|, the type of the camera pipeline must be changed in
   the |webgui| of the |rc_cube| under :menuselection:`System --> Camera Pipelines`
   (see https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/pipelines.html). Clicking on
   :guilabel:`Configure Camera Pipelines` opens a dialog that permits to change
   the type of pipeline to ``rc_viscore``. A reboot is necessary after changing the
   pipeline configuration.

   For connecting two stereo cameras at the same time, it is additionally necessary
   to configure a second pipeline, as explained above, and to specify which
   pipeline should use which |rc_viscore_camera| by setting a filter expression. This is
   done by clicking on :guilabel:`Configure Camera Connection` on the *Camera
   Pipelines* page, or select the corresponding pipeline in the menu, e.g. under
   :menuselection:`System --> Camera Pipelines --> Pipeline ...`. Clicking
   :guilabel:`Choose Camera` opens a dialog to edit the device filter (see also
   https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/pipelines.html#configuration-of-connected-cameras).

   It may take up to one minute until the |rc_viscore_camera| is connected. For each
   successfully connected sensor, the connection speed and frame rate is shown in
   the :menuselection:`Dashboard` of the |webgui|.

Connecting to the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. index::
  pair: connecting; SGM Producer

For using the |rc_viscore_camera| as high-resolution RGBD camera, |company| offers
the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer, which is a GenICam compatible transport :mvexclude:`layer (see
https://roboception.com/product/sgmproducer).` :mvonly:`layer.` 

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler
   
   The producer can be used with
   Halcon, with the rc_genicam_api for C++ programmers, with the rc_genicam_driver
   for ROS and ROS2, as well as with any other GenICam compatible application. It
   can be downloaded free of charge from https://www.roboception.com/download and
   installed on Windows and Ubuntu computers with an Nvidia graphics card.

.. only:: matrixvision

   Via the mvIMPACT Acquire API, the producer can be used with different programming
   languages, with Halcon, as well as with any other GenICam compatible application. It
   can be downloaded free of charge from https://www.matrix-vision.com and
   installed on Windows and Ubuntu computers with an Nvidia graphics card.

It is strongly recommended to connect both network cables directly to 1 gigabit
Ethernet ports of the computer. A network switch can only work if the network
link between the switch and the computer has a bandwidth of more than 2
gigabit, e.g. 2.5, 5 or 10 gigabit.

In the default network configuration and according to the GigE Vision\ |reg| standard,
the |rc_viscore_camera| cameras will try to obtain their configuration from a DHCP server
and fall back to the Link-Local self-configuration protocol, if no DHCP server
can be found. For direct connection without a DHCP server, the Ethernet
ports of the computer should be configured for Link-Local network. It is also
possible to manually configure IP addresses of the left and right camera.


.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   Options for changing the network settings and IP configuration are:

      * any configuration tool compatible with GigE Vision\ |reg| 2.0, 
        or |manufacturer|'s command-line tool ``gc_config``. Typically, these tools
        scan for all available GigE Vision\ |reg| devices on the network. All |rc_viscore_camera|
        devices can be uniquely identified by their serial number,
        which is printed on the device.
      
      * temporarily changing the network configuration via |manufacturer|'s
        ``rcdiscover-gui`` tool. The individual cameras can be seen in the list after unchecking
        the :guilabel:`Only Roboception devices` check box.

   .. only:: roboception or schunk

      .. note:: The command-line tool ``gc_config`` is part of |manufacturer|'s open-source
               convenience layer ``rc_genicam_api``, which can be downloaded free of charge
               for Windows and Linux from https://www.roboception.com/download.

.. only:: matrixvision

   The tool mvIPConfigure can be used for changing the network settings and the IP address. It is
   contained in the mvIMPACT Acquire driver for gigabit Ethernet cameras. The driver can be downloaded
   from https://www.matrix-vision.com/en/downloads. Alternatively, any other GigE Vision 2.0 compatible
   configuration tool can be used.


For adjusting the focus, checking and calibrating the |rc_viscore_camera|, as
explained in the next sections, the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer package contains a
calibration program, called `rc_calib`.

.. _sect-adjust-focus:

Adjust focus
------------

.. index:: ! focus adjustment
   single: working range
   single: aperture

It is highly recommended to check and adjust the focus of the |rc_viscore_camera| for the
actual working range. Please note that the depth of focus range is limited due
to the high resolution of the camera and must be adapted to the working range
of the application. At close distance, the depth of focus range is much smaller
than at higher distance. Therefore, the minimum distance for focusing should be
chosen as far away as useful for the application. Please 
:ref:`contact support<sect-contact>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{contact:sect-contact})` 
in case of questions regarding working distance and
calibration of the |rc_viscore_camera|.

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   The |rc_cube| offers a focus helper as part of camera calibration
   under :menuselection:`Pipeline ... --> Configuration --> Camera Calibration`.
   In the first step, the size of the calibration grid has to be specified. Clicking on
   :guilabel:`Next` opens the focus helper. See also
   https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/camera_calibration.html.

For users of the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer, the focus helper can be found in the `rc_calib`
calibration program after selecting the |rc_viscore_camera| with
:menuselection:`File --> Connect sensor ...`, and specifying the grid size.

The bars on the right side of the image report the blur of the calibration
grid, thus a minimum is desirable. The grid should be placed in the minimum and
maximum working distance for checking the current blur. A value near the lowest
dividing line is quite optimal. :mvexclude:`See also
https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/camera_calibration.html#adjust-focus.`

If focus adjustment is needed, the lens caps of the left and right cameras must
be removed as shown in :numref:`fig-focus`.

.. _fig-focus:
.. figure:: images/rcv_focus.png
   :width:  140mm
   :align: center

   Removing of lens caps for re-focussing and changing aperture

The focus ring and the aperture ring are locked by 3 screws for each ring as shown in
:numref:`fig-ricoh`. All three screws must be loosened for moving the ring.

.. _fig-ricoh:
.. figure:: images/ricoh_focus_aperture.png
   :width:  140mm
   :align: center

   Location of screws for focus and aperture ring

For setting the focus correctly, the calibration grid should be placed in the
middle of the working range. Then, the focus ring should be turned until the
bars in the images become a minimum. After focusing in this way, the
grid should be placed at the minimum and maximum working distance. If the blur
is unsatisfactory at the minimum and maximum working distance (e.g. near the
second dividing line or higher), the aperture can be closed a bit, i.e. choosing a
higher aperture number. Please be aware that this increases exposure time and
potentially gain, which increases noise in the image. The optimal tradeoff
is application dependent.

.. Warning:: The same aperture setting must be used for the left and right camera
   to avoid degraded image processing performance. Please validate that the left
   and right images appear with the same brightness.

After adjusting focus and aperture, all screws must be tightened and the lens
caps re-attached.

To change focus and aperture settings of the projector, loosen the three small
fixing Phillips screws on the respective ring of the projector lens, turn the
ring to the desired setting and lightly tighten the screws again. For focus
adjustments, the projector should be turned on permanently by setting the Out1
mode to High :mvexclude:`in the |webgui|.` :mvonly:`in the category DigitalIOControl.` 
For aperture adjustments, Out1 should be set to
ExposureAlternateActive and exposure mode should be set to â€šAutoâ€˜ :mvexclude:`on the |webgui|'s
Camera page.` :mvonly:`in the category AcquisitionControl.` Perfectly focusing the projector is not crucial. Slightly blurred
projection will not degrade the depth image.

After checking and potentially adjusting the focus, the next step is to check
calibration. This step should never be skipped and :mvexclude:`-- as opposed
to all |rc_visard| products --` is mandatory. Please note that the working range of the |rc_viscore_camera|
is pre-defined and the calibration should be checked for the minimum and
maximum working range. Please :ref:`contact support<sect-contact>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{contact:sect-contact})` in case of
questions regarding working distance and calibration of the |rc_viscore_camera|.
