Electronical and safety standards
=================================

The |rc_viscore_camera| has been designed to be in compliance with 2014/30/EU and 2011/65/EU. 
The |rc_viscore_camera| consists of the |rc_randomdot_projector| and two industrial vision cameras.

The |rc_randomdot_projector| has been tested based on the following harmonized standards:

* EN 61000-6-4:2007 + A1:2011 : Interference Emission
* EN 61000-6-2:2005 : Interference Immunity
* EN 62471:2008 / IEC 62471:2008 : Photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems

The industrial cameras have been tested based on the following harmonized standards:

* EN 61000-6-4:2007 + A1:2011 : Interference Emission
* EN 61000-6-2:2005 : Interference Immunity

The |rc_viscore_camera| is intended for use in the US only in industrial plants and is, therefore,
exempt from specific technical standards and other requirements of CFR Title 47, Part 15:

        *47 CFR § 15.103 - Exempted devices*

        *The following devices are subject only to the general conditions of operation in §§ 15.5 and 15.29 and

        representative that the device is causing harmful interference. Operation shall not resume until the condition 
        causing the harmful interference has been corrected. Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that 
        the manufacturer of an exempted device endeavor to have the device meet the specific technical standards in this part.
        (b) A digital device used exclusively as an electronic control or power system utilized by a public 
        utility or in an industrial plant. The term public utility includes equipment only to the extent that
        it is in a dedicated building or large room owned or leased by the utility and does not extend to
        equipment installed in a subscriber's facility.*

    The |rc_viscore_camera| is intended for use in Canada only in industrial plants/factories and, therefore,
    does not fall under the scope of ICES-003:
