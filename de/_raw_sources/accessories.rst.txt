Accessories
===========

Power connections
-----------------

.. index::
   single: power cable

The |rc_viscore_camera| contains an 8-pin A-coded M12 plug connector for power and GPIO connectivity
to the robot controller. Various cabling solutions can be obtained from third party vendors, however, the M12 connector on the
|rc_viscore_camera| side must be angled.
One possibility for an angled M12 to open ended cable is provided below. Customers are required to provide
power and GPIO connections to the cables according to the pinouts described
in :ref:`sect-wiring`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-wiring})`. The |rc_viscore_camera|'s housing must be connected to ground.

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

Power supplies
--------------

.. index::
   single: power supply

The |rc_viscore_camera| is classified as EN-55011 Class B device and is
immune to light industrial and industrial environments. For connecting the camera
to residential grid power, a power supply under EN 55011/55022 Class B has to be used.

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   It is the customer's responsibility to obtain and install a suitable power supply
   for permanent use in industrial environments.
   One example that satisfies both EN 61000-6-2 and EN 55011/55022 Class B is the DIN-Rail
   mounted PULS MiniLine ML70.100 24V/DC 3 A by PULS GmbH (http://www.pulspower.com).
   A certified electrician must perform installation.

.. only:: matrixvision

   You can obtain suitable DIN-Rail power supplies from |company|, e.g. BAE0112.

Only one |rc_viscore_camera| shall be connected to a power supply
at any time, and the total length of cables must be less than 15 m.

Spare parts
-----------

.. index::
   single: spare parts

|manufacturer| can provide calibration grids, power cables and network cables
as spare parts for |rc_viscore_camera| upon request.

SGM\ |reg|\ Producer :mvexclude:`and rc_cube`
---------------------------------------------

The |rc_viscore_camera| provides 12MP camera images and -- in combination with :mvexclude:`an
|rc_cube| or` the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer -- depth, confidence and error images.
The integrated |rc_randomdot_projector| allows for dense depth images even in
weakly textured scenes and the high resolution permits the detection of small
parts with high accuracy. The SGM\ |reg|\ Producer can be downloaded from
:mvexclude:`http://www.roboception.com/download` :mvonly:`https://www.matrix-vision.com`.

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   In combination with the |rc_cube|, the |rc_viscore_camera| provides the data for
   object detection and grasp computation applications, e.g. in industrial
   automation and logistics applications.
