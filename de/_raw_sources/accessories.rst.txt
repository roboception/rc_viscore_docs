Accessories
===========

Power connections
-----------------

.. index::
   single: power cable

The |rc_viscore| contains an 8-pin A-coded M12 plug connector for power and GPIO connectivity
to the robot controller. Various cabling solutions can be obtained from third party vendors, however, the M12 connector on the
|rc_viscore| side must be angled.
One possibility for an angled M12 to open ended cable is provided below. Customers are required to provide
power and GPIO connections to the cables according to the pinouts described
in :ref:`sect-wiring`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-wiring})`. The |rc_viscore|'s housing must be connected to ground.

**Sensor/Actor cable M12 socket to open end for power and GPIO connection**

- Angled M12 socket connector to open end, shielded 10m length: Phoenix Contact SAC-8P-10,0-PUR/M12FR SH, Art.Nr.: 1522943

**Network cable M12 X-coded to RJ45**

- Straight M12 X-coded to RJ45 CAT6A cable, 10m length, 2 required per |rc_viscore|: Phoenix Contact NBC-M12MSX/10,0-94F/R4AC, Art.Nr.: 1407474

Power supplies
--------------

.. index::
   single: power supply

The |rc_viscore| is classified as EN-55011 Class B device and is
immune to light industrial and industrial environments. For connecting the sensor
to residential grid power, a power supply under EN 55011/55022 Class B has to be used.

It is the customer's responsibility to obtain and install a suitable power supply
for permanent use in industrial environments.
One example that satisfies both EN 61000-6-2 and EN 55011/55022 Class B is the DIN-Rail
mounted PULS MiniLine ML70.100 24V/DC 3 A by PULS GmbH (http://www.pulspower.com).
A certified electrician must perform installation.

Only one |rc_viscore| shall be connected to a power supply
at any time, and the total length of cables must be less than 15 m.

Spare parts

   single: spare parts

|manufacturer| can provide calibration grids, power cables and network cables
as spare parts for |rc_viscore| upon request.

SGM\ |reg|\ Producer and rc_cube
--------------------------------

The |rc_viscore| provides 12MP camera images and -- in combination with an
|rc_cube| or the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer -- depth, confidence and error images.
The integrated |rc_randomdot| projector allows for dense depth images even in
weakly textured scenes and the high resolution permits the detection of small
parts with high accuracy. The SGM\ |reg|\ Producer can be downloaded from
http://www.roboception.com/download.

In combination with the |rc_cube|, the |rc_viscore| provides the data for
object detection and grasp computation applications, e.g. in industrial
automation and logistics applications.
