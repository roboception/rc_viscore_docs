============

.. index::
   single: installation

.. Warning:: The instructions on :ref:`sect-safety`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{safety:sect-safety})`
  related to the |rc_viscore_camera| must be read and understood prior to installation.

Mounting
--------

.. index::
   single: mounting

The |rc_viscore_camera| is intended to be mounted on a wall or ceiling above the target
area. It is not intended to be used in dynamic applications mounted to a robot
wrist. It is the customer’s responsibility to provide an adequate mounting
bracket.

For mounting, the |rc_viscore_camera| provides an M4 and M5 thread pattern on its top and
bottom sides (see :numref:`fig-mounting`). A medium-strength thread-locker or
Tuflok\ |reg| screws must be used to protect against vibrations. M5 screws must be
tightened to 4.0 Nm, M4 screws must be tightened to 3.3 Nm.

.. Warning:: The |rc_viscore_camera| cannot be mounted on the end-effector of a robot.

   Mounting of the |rc_viscore_camera|

Only the surface containing the thread pattern must be in contact with the
mounting bracket, all other surfaces must remain free. At least 10 cm clearance
must be provided behind the |rc_viscore_camera| to facilitate adequate air flow for
cooling.

Power-up
--------

.. index::
  single: power-up

.. Note:: Always fully connect and tighten all M12 connectors on the |rc_viscore_camera|
  *before* turning on the power supply.

After connecting the system to power, the LED on the front of the |rc_viscore_camera| should
immediately illuminate.

.. Warning:: Do not look into the projector lens in the center of the |rc_viscore_camera| or
   into the light beam at any point during startup or operation.

Connecting
----------

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler
      
   The |rc_viscore_camera| can be used together with an |rc_cube| or as a stand-alone high-resolution 
   RGBD camera with the SGM\ |reg|\ producer. The following sections describe
   connecting the |rc_viscore_camera| in both scenarios.

   Connecting to the rc_cube
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++

   .. index::
      pair: connecting; rc_cube

   The |rc_cube| I (Industrial Edge Computer) offers four network ports that are
   labelled sensors 0-3. The two network cables of the |rc_viscore_camera| must be
   connected directly to two of those ports. It does not matter which ones. Two
   stereo cameras can be connected and used at the same time.

   The |rc_cube| S (Edge Computer) offers one 2.5 gigabit sensor port. A switch
   must be used for connecting an |rc_viscore_camera|. The switch must support 2.5
   gigabit for the connection to the |rc_cube| and 1 gigabit speed for the
   connection to the |rc_viscore_camera|. The switch is not in the scope of the delivery
   of the |rc_cube| S. |manufacturer| can recommend a suitable switch upon
   request.

   By default, the |rc_cube| is configured to support one |rc_visard| as sensor. For
   supporting one |rc_viscore_camera|, the type of the camera pipeline must be changed in
   the |webgui| of the |rc_cube| under :menuselection:`System --> Camera Pipelines`
   (see https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/pipelines.html). Clicking on
   :guilabel:`Configure Camera Pipelines` opens a dialog that permits to change
   the type of pipeline to ``rc_viscore``. A reboot is necessary after changing the
   pipeline configuration.

   For connecting two stereo cameras at the same time, it is additionally necessary
   to configure a second pipeline, as explained above, and to specify which
   pipeline should use which |rc_viscore_camera| by setting a filter expression. This is
   done by clicking on :guilabel:`Configure Camera Connection` on the *Camera
   Pipelines* page, or select the corresponding pipeline in the menu, e.g. under
   :menuselection:`System --> Camera Pipelines --> Pipeline ...`. Clicking
   :guilabel:`Choose Camera` opens a dialog to edit the device filter (see also
   https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/pipelines.html#configuration-of-connected-cameras).

   It may take up to one minute until the |rc_viscore_camera| is connected. For each
   successfully connected sensor, the connection speed and frame rate is shown in
   the :menuselection:`Dashboard` of the |webgui|.

Connecting to the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. index::
  pair: connecting; SGM Producer

For using the |rc_viscore_camera| as high-resolution RGBD camera, |company| offers
the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer, which is a GenICam compatible transport :mvexclude:`layer (see
https://roboception.com/product/sgmproducer).` :mvonly:`layer.` 

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler
   
   The producer can be used with
   Halcon, with the rc_genicam_api for C++ programmers, with the rc_genicam_driver
   for ROS and ROS2, as well as with any other GenICam compatible application. It
   can be downloaded free of charge from https://www.roboception.com/download and
   installed on Windows and Ubuntu computers with an Nvidia graphics card.

.. only:: matrixvision

   Via the mvIMPACT Acquire API, the producer can be used with different programming
   languages, with Halcon, as well as with any other GenICam compatible application. It
   can be downloaded free of charge from https://www.balluff.com and
   installed on Windows and Ubuntu computers with an Nvidia graphics card.

It is strongly recommended to connect both network cables directly to 1 gigabit
Ethernet ports of the computer. When using a network switch, the network
link between the switch and the computer should have a bandwidth of more than 2
gigabit, e.g. 2.5, 5 or 10 gigabit. Otherwise, the full frame rate cannot be reached.

In the default network configuration and according to the GigE Vision\ |reg| standard,
the |rc_viscore_camera| will try to obtain its configuration from a DHCP server
and fall back to the Link-Local self-configuration protocol, if no DHCP server
can be found. For direct connection without a DHCP server, the Ethernet
ports of the computer should be configured for Link-Local network. It is also
possible to manually configure IP addresses of the left and right camera.


.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   Options for changing the network settings and IP configuration are:

      * any configuration tool compatible with GigE Vision\ |reg| 2.0, 
        or |manufacturer|'s command-line tool ``gc_config``. Typically, these tools
        scan for all available GigE Vision\ |reg| devices on the network. All |rc_viscore_camera|
        devices can be uniquely identified by their serial number,
        which is printed on the device.
      
      * temporarily changing the network configuration via |manufacturer|'s
        ``rcdiscover-gui`` tool. The individual cameras can be seen in the list after unchecking
        the :guilabel:`Only Roboception devices` check box.

   .. only:: roboception or schunk

      .. note:: The command-line tool ``gc_config`` is part of |manufacturer|'s open-source
               convenience layer ``rc_genicam_api``, which can be downloaded free of charge
               for Windows and Linux from https://www.roboception.com/download.

.. only:: matrixvision

   The tool mvIPConfigure can be used for changing the network settings and the IP address. It is
   contained in the mvIMPACT Acquire driver for gigabit Ethernet cameras. The driver can be downloaded
   from https://www.balluff.com. Alternatively, any other GigE Vision 2.0 compatible
   configuration tool can be used.


For adjusting the focus, checking and calibrating the |rc_viscore_camera|, as
explained in the next sections, the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer package contains a
calibration program, called :mvexclude:`rc_calib,` :mvonly:`3D_calib,` and a
viewer program, called :mvexclude:`rc_viewer.` :mvonly:`3D_viewer.`

.. _sect-adjust-focus:

Adjust camera focus
-------------------

.. index:: ! focus adjustment
   single: working range
   single: aperture

It is highly recommended to check the focus of the |rc_viscore_camera| for the
actual working range. By default, |manufacturer| focuses the |rc_viscore_camera| to a distance of 1.6 m
(unless otherwise specified by the customer), which results in a working range of approximately 1.4-2.0 m. 
If a different working range is used in the application, the focus 
must be adapted. Please note that the focus range is limited due
to the high resolution of the camera. At close distance, the focus range is much smaller
than at higher distances. Therefore, the minimum distance for focusing should be
chosen as far away as useful for the application.

If focus adjustment is needed, the lens caps of the left and right cameras must
be removed as shown in :numref:`fig-focus`.

   Removing of lens caps for re-focusing and changing aperture

The focus ring and the aperture ring (iris ring) are locked by 3 screws for each ring as shown in
:numref:`fig-ricoh`. All three screws must be loosened for moving a ring.

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   The |rc_cube| offers a focus helper as part of camera calibration
   on the |webgui| under :menuselection:`Pipeline ... --> Configuration --> Camera Calibration`.
   In the first step, the size of the calibration grid has to be specified. Clicking on
   :guilabel:`Next` opens the focus helper. See also
   https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/camera_calibration.html.

In the SGM\ |reg|\ Producer, a focus helper can be found in the
calibration program :mvexclude:`rc_calib`:mvonly:`3D_calib` after selecting the |rc_viscore_camera| with
:menuselection:`File --> Connect sensor ...`, and specifying the grid size.

The bars on the right side of the focus helper image report the blur of the calibration
grid, thus a minimum is desirable. :mvexclude:`See also
https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/camera_calibration.html#adjust-focus.`

For setting the focus correctly, the calibration grid should be placed in the
middle of the working range. Then, the focus ring of each camera should be turned until the
bar in the corresponding image becomes minimal. A value near the lowest
dividing line is desirable. After focusing in this way, the
grid should be placed at the minimum and maximum working distance. If the blur
is unsatisfactory at the minimum and maximum working distance (e.g. near the
second dividing line or higher), the aperture of the camera can be closed a bit by turning the iris ring, i.e. a
higher aperture number should be chosen to expand the focus range of the cameras. 
Please be aware that this also increases exposure time and
potentially gain, which increases noise in the image. The optimal tradeoff
is application dependent. The default aperture number of the cameras is 4.

.. Warning:: The same aperture setting must be used for the left and right camera
   to avoid degraded image processing performance. Please validate that the left
   and right images appear with the same brightness.

After adjusting focus and aperture, all screws must be lightly tightened and the lens
caps must be re-attached.

.. Warning:: It is mandatory to always check calibration after
   changing the focus or aperture of the |rc_viscore_camera|
   (see :ref:`sect-calibration`:latex:`, Section \ref{installation:sect-calibration}`) .

Please :ref:`contact support<sect-contact>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{contact:sect-contact})` 
in case of questions regarding working distance and focusing of the |rc_viscore_camera|.


.. _sect-adjust-projector-focus:

Adjust projector focus
----------------------

.. index:: ! projector
   single: projector focus

During production, the focus of the projector is adjusted to match the focus distance of the cameras,
which is 1.6 m by default (unless otherwise specified by the customer). Perfectly focusing 
the projector is not crucial. A slightly blurred projection pattern will not degrade the depth image.

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   To inspect the sharpness of the projector pattern, the projector should be turned on permanently
   by setting the *Out1 / Projector* mode to ``High`` on the |rc_cube| |webgui| under 
   :menuselection:`Pipeline ... --> Camera --> IOControl Settings` or :menuselection:`Pipeline ... --> Configuration --> IOControl`. 

.. only:: matrixvision

   To inspect the sharpness of the projector pattern, the projector should be turned on permanently
   by setting the *Out1 / Projector* mode to ``High`` on the 3D_viewer *Depth* page. 

The projector focus only needs to be adjusted when the projector pattern is strongly blurred.
In this case, loosen the three small
fixing Phillips screws on the focus ring of the projector lens as shown in :numref:`fig-ricoh`.
Then, turn the focus ring until the visible projector pattern becomes sharp. 
After that, lightly tighten the focus ring screws again.


.. _sect-adjust-projector-aperture:

Adjust projector aperture
-------------------------

.. index:: ! projector
   single: projector brightness
   single: projector aperture

The aperture of the projector influences the brightness of the projector pattern. By default,
the aperture of the projector is fully open, which means the projector has maximum brightness.
The aperture should be adjusted so that the brightness difference between images taken
with projector and images taken without projector is not too large, but the projector pattern is 
still visible in the images taken with projector. To find the correct setting, make sure the external
light in the working environment is similar to what is expected during productive mode and the 
|rc_viscore_camera| is mounted at the desired distance from the scene.

.. only:: roboception or schunk or basler

   Then, on the |rc_cube| |webgui| under :menuselection:`Pipeline ... --> Camera`, set the 
   *Exposure* mode to ``Auto`` and set the *Auto Exposure Mode* to ``AdaptiveOut1``.
   Also set the *Out1 / Projector* mode to ``ExposureAlternateActive`` under *IOControl Settings*,
   so that every second image is taken with projector pattern.
   Now, the text line under the live images shows the *Out1 reduction* value in percent.

.. only:: matrixvision

   Then, in the 3D_viewer, set the *Auto exposure mode* on the *Camera* page to ``AdaptiveOut1`` 
   and set the *Out1 / Projector* mode of the *Depth* page to ``ExposureAlternateActive``, so that every second image is
   taken with projector pattern. Now, the status bar of the 3D_viewer shows the *Out1 reduction* as a value between 0 and 1.

The *Out1 reduction* value describes the reduction of the brightness of the image without projection compared to the 
image with projection. The value should be between 10% and 20%. A higher *Out1 reduction* value means, that the projector is
too bright compared to the external lighting, which leads to images without projector patterns being too dark.
Thus, external lighting should be increased, e.g. by installing an additional
light source, or the brightness of the projector should be reduced by slightly closing the aperture. In analogy, if the 
*Out1 reduction* value is too low, the projector is not bright enough compared to the external light,
which means that the projector pattern will hardly be visible in the camera images and cannot enhance the depth computation.
So the external light should be reduced or the projector brightness must be increased by opening the aperture.

The aperture of the projector can be adjusted by loosening the three small
fixing Phillips screws on the iris ring of the projector lens as shown in :numref:`fig-ricoh`.
Then, turn the iris ring until the *Out1 reduction* value is in the range between 10% and 20%. 

After that, the darkest object that is possible in the application should be placed in the field of view of the camera.
If the dark object is not properly visible in the depth image, then the projector brightness must be increased, 
despite high *Out1 reduction* values.

In the end, lightly tighten the iris ring screws again.

After checking and potentially adjusting the focus of the cameras, the next step is to check
the camera calibration. This step should never be skipped and :mvexclude:`-- as opposed
to all |rc_visard| products --` is mandatory. Please note that the working range of the |rc_viscore_camera|
is pre-defined and the calibration should be checked for the minimum and
